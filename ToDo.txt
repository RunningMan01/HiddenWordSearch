1. Modify classes so eg. HiddenWord public methods aren't exposed to calling client - done
2. Error words should be just a string
3. If really keen could add error handling to check for valid range of values entered etc.

UI front end
separate javascript object / partial view

partial view - Grid[,] char passed in with List<HiddenWord>
canvas to draw grid on
poc array passed in, just draw on canvas 

* Add new javascript file with general html manipulation methods - set text, add event etc.
* Add error checking on within HiddenWordSeach control (C#) - eg. Title must be specified, no words greater than rows / columns etc.
2. Start looking at flex grid / grid settings (possibly not bothered about mobile etc.)
4. List hidden words to side / underneath Grid
5. When selecting a hidden word, make sure crossed out words aren't re-selected


Done 
6. Need to copy area overwritten when initial letter is selected, to be replaced if hidden word
   is not selected (Done)
3. Draw words / letters on canvas
* Configuring row and column different to 10 doesn't resize correctly
