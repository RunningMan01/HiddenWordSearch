1. Modify classes so eg. HiddenWord public methods aren't exposed to calling client - done
2. Error words should be just a string
3. If really keen could add error handling to check for valid range of values entered etc.


UI front end
separate javascript object / partial view

partial view - Grid[,] char passed in with List<HiddenWord>
canvas to draw grid on
poc array passed in, just draw on canvas
