Next steps

1. Tidy up and document where solution is 
- Check any bugs
- Save wordsearches, allow search, retrieval ??

1. Look at editWordSearch method in index.js


1. Modify classes so eg. HiddenWord public methods aren't exposed to calling client - done
2. Error words should be just a string
3. If really keen could add error handling to check for valid range of values entered etc.
4. Do this next - Remove default values from _configureModal, pass these in to constructor method and implement Edit function
    ** Recode modalConfigure to pass in array of property / values items and retrieve an array of property / item values
	** add public property for wordSearchConfigruation
	** Also need to act according to whether cancel was clicked
    ** Place Edit and regenerate options above card showing word search itself **
	Would need additional Edit button 
	Edit button would need access to wordsearch settings
	Configure modal passed in current settings
	Have a regenerate button as well to recreate wordsearch with current settings

- Add menu items to allow New word search to be generated - New, Load, Save
- Remove default word search settings - countries
- Unit test coverage
- Some sort of documentation - class diagrams

UI front end
separate javascript object / partial view

partial view - Grid[,] char passed in with List<HiddenWord>
canvas to draw grid on
poc array passed in, just draw on canvas 

* Add new javascript file with general html manipulation methods - set text, add event etc.
* Add error checking on within HiddenWordSeach control (C#) - eg. Title must be specified, no words greater than rows / columns etc.
2. Start looking at flex grid / grid settings (possibly not bothered about mobile etc.)
4. List hidden words to side / underneath Grid
5. When selecting a hidden word, make sure crossed out words aren't re-selected


Done 
6. Need to copy area overwritten when initial letter is selected, to be replaced if hidden word
   is not selected (Done)
3. Draw words / letters on canvas
* Configuring row and column different to 10 doesn't resize correctly
